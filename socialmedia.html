              <br><br><b>Caption:</b> 
                <br>Dead trees often get treated as trash or fuel sources in the Philippines, but they play a vital role in storing carbon and nurturing ecosystems. Considering how it’s more important than ever before to preserve biodiversity, we need to accept that “ugly” doesn’t always equate to “worthless”. Next time you see some deadwood, try getting up close and personal with the beautiful nature it nurtures!

                <br><br><b>Card 1</b>
                <br>TITLE: DEAD TREES or deadwood are trees that have died due to fires, fungal diseases, insect infestations, or extreme weather.

                <br><br><b>Card 2</b>
                <br>TITLE: Why are they considered ugly?
                <br>BODY: Because they aren’t green, people assume dead trees have no value and can only be used for fuel or construction.
                <br>SUBTITLE: BUT THEY'RE VERY WRONG.

                <br><br><b>Card 3</b>
                <br>TITLE: Why are they important?
                <br>BODY: 8% of forest-sequestered carbon is stored in dead trees – so much carbon that burning them emits more CO2 than gas or coal.

                <br><br><b>Card 4</b>
                <br>TITLE: Why are they important?
                <br>BODY: Dead trees increase the biodiversity in a forest ecosystem, making it more healthy and stable.

                <br><br><b>Card 5</b>
                <br>TITLE: Why are they important?
                <br>BODY: The bark, snags, cavities, and branches of dead trees provide shelter for birds, bats, reptiles, and various pollinators.

                <br><br><b>Card 6</b>
                <br>TITLE: Why are they important?
                <br>BODY: Decomposers such as ants, fungi, and lichen use dead trees as a food source. In turn, their work produces an important source of nutrients for the rest of the forest ecosystem.

                <br><br><b>Card 7</b>
                <br>TITLE: Why are they important?
                <br>BODY: Logs interrupt the flow of water and help filter out sediment, protecting the purity of watersheds.

                <br><br><b>Card 8</b>
                <br>TITLE: Why are they important?
                <br>BODY: Dead trees provide shade, shelter, and moisture, all of which help new tree seedlings grow.

                <br><br><b>Card 9</b>
                <br>TITLE: In the Philippines, deadwood is often removed from forest ecosystems – whether to be burned as fuel, make scenery more aesthetic, or create the illusion of a more “healthy” ecosystem.

                <br><br><b>Card 10</b>
                <br>TITLE: CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE REMOVED ALL DEADWOOD FROM FOREST ECOSYSTEMS?
