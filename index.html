        <h3>Welcome to my portfolio!</h3>
        <p>
          <br>I'm Katelynn Bautista Young, a freelance assistant editor and social media manager, as well as a Cum Laude graduate from the University of Philippines Cebu.
          <br>
          <br>I've been storytelling for companies since 2021, and I'm a seasoned professional when it comes to writing and editing both creative and copy materials. Currently, I specialize in creating content about sustainability in the form of workshops and social media copy and graphics — with my work convincing a Fortune 500 client to sign with my company for several series of workshops.
          <br>
          <br>In general, I have extensive experience in creating copy for various types of media — including websites, emails, video scripts, SEO articles, proposal bids, and press releases — for topics that ranged from technology and business to marketing and recreation. Throughout my career, I have acted as a virtual marketing assistant, with my responsibilities including social media management (including creation, scheduling, management, and analysis of posts) and digital marketing tasks (including creation of promotional presentations). I have also acted as an administrative assistant, taking charge of data entry, file organization, SOP creation, process documentation, onboarding workflow creation, and recruitment.
          <br>
          <br>Over the past few years, I’ve been part of many different work settings, but I am most comfortable with remote, asynchronous setups where I have to work independently. I am skilled with tools such as HubSpot, Canva, Asana, AirTable, Notion, ClickUp, Trello, Slack, and Google Workspace. I work best as part of an organized team that communicates openly and states expectations clearly, and I appreciate environments that cultivate learning and invest in their employees' continuing education.
          <br>
          <br>Throughout my career, I have been dedicated to constant improvement, no matter what job I am undertaking. If I am not constrained by any rules or limitations, it is in my nature to try to optimize everything that involves me — whether it's content creation or workflow. I enjoy taking initiative, and, if I am allowed to do so, I use free work hours to build processes that make results more efficient and consistent. Because of my flexibility, expertise, and drive, I believe that I would be of great value to your team.
