        <h3>Welcome to my portfolio!</h3>
        <p>
          <br>If you're wondering who I am, let me introduce myself: I'm Katelynn Bautista Young — a freelance assistant editor and social media manager, as well as a Cum Laude graduate from the University of the Philippines - Cebu.
          <br>
          <br>As an assistant editor, I have specialized in creating sustainability-focused content for workshops that are delivered to Fortune 1000 companies. My work at The Carbonauts convinced a Fortune 500 client to sign for several more series of workshops, exemplifying the quality of my work. In addition to that, I have managed The Carbonauts' social media accounts and also created articles, social media content, and press releases to promote their sustainability education workshops. 
          <br>
          <br>In the past, I created content for websites, emails, SEO articles, and video scripts as a freelance writer. Throughout my career, I have written content and copy for everything from sustainability and science to marketing and technology, proving my flexibility and versatility as a writer.
          <br>
          <br>Over the past few years, I've found that I'm most comfortable with remote, asynchronous setups where I have to work independently and communicate clearly with my team. I am skilled in tools such as HubSpot, Canva, Asana, AirTable, Notion, ClickUp, Trello, Slack, and Google Workspace, and I work best in environments that cultivate continuous learning.
          <br>
          <br>To be frank, the main reason I'm a great addition to any company is because I'm <i>just</i> Type A enough to be dedicated to constant improvement, whether it's in the way I produce content or how I optimize my workflow. I enjoy taking initiative — proven by how I am working my way through several professional certificate courses and have put myself through a climate-centered professional fellowship, all of my own accord. I take every opportunity to learn more, work smarter, and produce better, more consistent results. Therefore, I'm searching for a company that I can thrive in — not just as a professional, but also as a creative who loves to hone her craft.
          <br>
