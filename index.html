        <h3>Welcome to my portfolio!</h3>
        <p>
          <br>I'm Katelynn Bautista Young, a freelance copywriter and assistant editor, as well as a Cum Laude graduate from the University of Philippines Cebu.
          <br>
          <br>I've been writing professionally since 2021, and I've gained considerable experience in writing and editing both creative and copy materials over the years. Currently, I specialize in creating content about sustainability. However, I also have extensive experience in creating SEO articles and various types of media, including websites, press releases, video scripts, and social media copy.
          <br>
          <br>Over the course of the past few years, I’ve been part of various work settings, but I am most comfortable with remote setups where I have to work independently. I work best as part of an organized team that communicates openly and states expectations clearly, and I appreciate environments that cultivate learning.
          <br>
          <br>Throughout my career, I have been dedicated to constant improvement no matter what job I am undertaking. If I am not constrained by any rules or limitations, it is in my nature to try to optimize everything that involves me—whether it's content creation or workflow. I enjoy taking initiative, and, if I am allowed to do so, I use free work hours to build processes that make results more efficient and consistent.
