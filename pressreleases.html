              <br><br>On July 30 and 31, 2022, Panublix held Slow Yarn, a 2-day workshop on crocheting, sustainable fashion, and mindfulness that celebrated handmade arts and promoted an eco-conscious way of life. As a tech platform that connects designers with tropical textiles and yarns, Panublix organized this event in collaboration with YSEALI, Welby, and The Attic Yarn & Craftery.
              <br><br>Slow Yarn welcomed members of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) from all over South Luzon. As part of the U.S. government's signature program for leadership development and networking in Southeast Asia, YSEALI members were invited to get in touch with their creativity in-person and remotely.
                <br><br>Day 1 of Slow Yarn featured a Crochet 101 workshop led by Ceryl Tubungan of The Attic Yarn & Craftery in Marikina, where participants learned how to crochet using Panublix cotton crochet yarns. 
                <br><br>While participants worked on their creations, a discussion on the environmental impact of the clothing industry and market was moderated by Mela Gonzales of Reclamare.PH and Ally Gutierrez of Panublix. The workshop was also graced with the presence of Jen Goldstein, Cultural Affairs Officer of the US Embassy in the Philippines.
                <br><br>Day 2 of Slow Yarn featured an online Creative Mindfulness workshop hosted by Kirstin Pareja of Welby, which helped participants develop healthier mindsets through personal mandala, intention-setting, and meaning-making.
                <br><br>Finally – after two days of learning more about the intersection of sustainability, fashion, and creativity – Slow Yarn ended with a showcase of participants' mandalas and crocheted creations.
