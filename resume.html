            Looking back on my life, I realize that I've always written as a way
            to experience life. Although this also applied to venting through
            writing (which I did very often), I primarily used writing as a way
            to create new experiences. If I wanted to go on a grand adventure or
            travel to another country, I'd simply write a story where - through
            my characters - I could do that. If I wanted to understand what
            being brave, or successful, or in love was like, I'd create a world
            where I <i>was</i> that. All I needed was a pencil, some paper, and
            my imagination. <br /><br />
            Over the years, I have had more chances to experience things
            firsthand. So, although I still do write my life into being, I now
            use writing to explore topics that I want to comment on (and,
            sometimes, to just have fun - can you believe it?). I'm still honing
            my craft, but I hope that, eventually, my works can contribute to
            society in a positive way.

          <h4>What does being a writer/creator mean to you?</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="abouttext">
          <p>
            This one is tricky! Honestly, anyone can be a creator, but I think
            what really legitimizes someone in their field of creativity is 1)
            the quality of their work, and 2) the effort they put into their
            pursuits. For me, receiving formal training or being picked up by a
            traditional publisher/record label/etc isn't as important,
            especially nowadays, with how social media can empower creators to
            take charge of their own work and career.
            <br /><br />
            But even with this personal definition, it's still hard to view
            myself as a <i>real</i> writer and singer, especially during periods
            when I don't have enough time or energy to really hone my craft. So,
            for now, being a writer and creator means doing my best to produce
            works that make me happy, and that others can (hopefully) enjoy.

            I've always been a creative person, so my habit of crafting and
            writing things started when I was around three. I was very confident
            back then (I still am, but I'm a little more realistic now), so I
            always thought along the lines of, "This person wrote/drew/made
            this, so why can't I? It looks easy." Thus began my frustration with
            the difference between theory and reality.
            <br /><br />
            Writing came most naturally for me, especially since I was an avid
            reader, but everything else was a struggle because - shocker - I
            actually had to learn and practice. It took me years to develop my
            hobbies into productive skills: stitching to sewing, screeching to
            singing, and scribbling to drawing, among others. I still have a
            ways to go for everything, including writing, but I'd say it's been
            a good first two decades!

            That my works aim to be intriguing! I want to build worlds and weave
            narratives that make you wonder and think, especially when it comes
            to the darkest aspects of our reality.
            <br /><br />
            To achieve this, my stories are sometimes depressing; other times,
            they are innocent on the surface, but when you pay attention to
            what's going on, you realize they are extremely disturbing. I have
            to admit, it's very fun to mess with my readers every now and then.

            When it comes to prose, I'm influenced by all the books and authors
            I've read (which is a LOT). However, some authors of note would be
            Betty Smith, Markus Zusak, Eoin Colfer, and Jane Austen. The main
            thread tying them all together is their ability to write about
            different life experiences, no matter how dark, with a touch of
            humor and empathy.
            <br /><br />
            In terms of songwriting: I have two main influences: Michael Franks
            and Mariah Carey. Again, their sense of humor is amazing, but they
            also have a talent for using on-point cultural references, amazing
            vocabulary, poetic lyricism, and intricate melodies. Not to mention
            I could listen to their songs all day!

            I have to divvy this up into three parts: writing, music, and
            career.
            <br /><br />
            For my writing, my biggest aspirations are to publish several novels
            and poetry collections, some through self-publishing and some
            through traditional publishing. I'd also love to create a comic
            series and an interactive fiction game!
            <br /><br />
            I'm an indie artist, so I don't expect to ever have as much
            recognition as mainstream artists backed by big record labels, but I
            would love it if I could grow a small, dedicated fanbase! I'm also
            hoping to professionally record and release all of my albums in a
            few years' time.
            <br /><br />
            Finally, for my career, I plan to specialize in environmental
            science/economics and work for environmentally focused NGOs and companies.

            When I'm not working or studying (aka "workwork"), I typically
            write, sing, and create (aka "funwork").
            <br /><br />
            When I'm not doing funwork, I do more casual hobbies, like sewing,
            reading, and crafting small gifts for friends - which usually
            involves a lot of origami. And of course, I hangout and chat with my
            friends, who are my amazing support system.

            I...am not sure. My scheduling style is very loosely outlined, so I
            usually just allot days to do certain things, rather than scheduling
            strict time periods. As long as I can get work/homework done by the
            deadline, all is good.
            <br /><br />
            For personal projects, the timelines are even less strict since
            creations take a while to perfect. If I wasn't so eager to show my
            works to friends, I'd probably never get anything done!
            <br /><br />
            The key is just knowing when you want/need to get things done by,
            then making sure you have enough time before then. Pacing is the
            most important for me because I don't like cramming or stressing.
            Consistency is also key, but I only really apply that to my
            exercising HAHA.
