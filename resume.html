            Looking back on my life, I realize that I've always written as a way
            to experience life. Although this also applied to venting through
            writing (which I did very often), I primarily used writing as a way
            to create new experiences. If I wanted to go on a grand adventure or
            travel to another country, I'd simply write a story where - through
            my characters - I could do that. If I wanted to understand what
            being brave, or successful, or in love was like, I'd create a world
            where I <i>was</i> that. All I needed was a pencil, some paper, and
            my imagination. <br /><br />
            Over the years, I have had more chances to experience things
            firsthand. So, although I still do write my life into being, I now
            use writing to explore topics that I want to comment on (and,
            sometimes, to just have fun - can you believe it?). I'm still honing
            my craft, but I hope that, eventually, my works can contribute to
            society in a positive way.

            When I'm not working or studying (aka "workwork"), I typically
            write, sing, and create (aka "funwork").
            <br /><br />
            When I'm not doing funwork, I do more casual hobbies, like sewing,
            reading, and crafting small gifts for friends - which usually
            involves a lot of origami. And of course, I hangout and chat with my
            friends, who are my amazing support system.

            I...am not sure. My scheduling style is very loosely outlined, so I
            usually just allot days to do certain things, rather than scheduling
            strict time periods. As long as I can get work/homework done by the
            deadline, all is good.
            <br /><br />
            For personal projects, the timelines are even less strict since
            creations take a while to perfect. If I wasn't so eager to show my
            works to friends, I'd probably never get anything done!
            <br /><br />
            The key is just knowing when you want/need to get things done by,
            then making sure you have enough time before then. Pacing is the
            most important for me because I don't like cramming or stressing.
            Consistency is also key, but I only really apply that to my
            exercising HAHA.
